**Supabase Android Notes App**

This is a simple Android app I built while learning how to use Supabase with Android.
Right now, it connects to a Supabase database and lets you add, view, edit, and delete notes.
It’s basically a small notes app that shows how database operations work using Supabase.

**How to Run It**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/PrinceJoseph-software/Supabase.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Add your Supabase credentials in a local file (for example, `.env` or `local.properties`):

   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
   ```
4. Make sure these credentials are not pushed to GitHub.
5. Run the app.

**Note on Security**

I’ve hidden my Supabase URL and key for security reasons.
If you want to try this out, you’ll need to create your own Supabase project and use your own credentials.
